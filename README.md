Instructions for running TextMag

1. Install AndroidStudios
2. Clone the GitHub Repo for the Android App
3. Access the TextMag Folder
4. Create the emulator Pixel 6 API 34
6. Run the App

Note that it is necessary to allow camera permission while running the app.
To do this, access app info by holding on the app and navigate to "Permissions -> Camera" and allow use of the camera while using the app.

Note that the camera preview while running on the emulator will show a preset image. As a result, live text recognition features will not be possible unless you run it on an actual Android device.
